# Weather-Journal App Project

This my third project for Front-end
The project is about to create an asynchronous web app 


## How to start

You need to have Node.js and npm locally installed. You can check that by running `node -v && npm -v` in terminal. This should result in two versions shown in terminal.

Then, you have to run `npm start` in order to run the express server locally.
